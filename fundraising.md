Dear Parents,

We're on the cusp of a game-changing upgrade for our young athletes — the introduction of the Veo Cam sports camera to our football programme. This state-of-the-art technology promises to revolutionise the way we view and analyse the game, offering individualised video highlights and constructive feedback to players, and delivering exhilarating game moments to you through Phoenix TV.

We're already making headway with £1,000 secured, propelling us a third of the way towards our initial £3,000 goal. Achieving this will allow us to feature a minimum of X% of the U14 Pinks and Blacks matches, alongside X% of the U12 Pinks, Blacks, and Oranges encounters on Phoenix TV.

## But let's dream bigger!

A stretch goal of reaching £4,000 would enable us to purchase a second Veo Cam, thereby amplifying our coverage to X% of U14 Pinks and Blacks games, and X% for each of the U12 teams. If we can reach this we'll be the Sky Sports of grassroots girls football in Scotland!
